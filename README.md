# Aller-Ternatives

Aller-ternatives will provide an application for people with allergies to more easily search for food items that are safe for them to eat. It will allow the user to enter in their allergens and food preferences and then search for either a grocery item or a restaurant food item/category that would normally contain the user’s allergen(s). The application will either pull up grocery items that can alternatively be used if the user searched for a grocery item or restaurant menu items that do not contain the user’s allergen(s) if they are searching for restaurant food.

The app will collect data from restaurants and will use an API to collect data from grocery stores. There will be the ability for certain restaurants to appear as “verified” by connecting with the creators of the application and submitting a special form that will collect data about how each menu item is prepared and what substitutions can be made. 

The app will be available for iOS and Android devices and will be developed using the Dart programming language.
